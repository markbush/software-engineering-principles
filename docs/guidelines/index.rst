Software Engineering :index:`Guidelines` 
========================================

I have a personal list of *Rules of Software Engineering* as follows:

1. There are no rules!

Rules suggest very strongly that they should never be broken.  By sticking blindly to rules, making decisions about application development based on a series of logical choices, can easily result in very complex code that is hard to understand and hard to maintain.

Instead, I think in terms of *guidelines*.  These are principles which guide me, but don't control me.  I can step back, look at the big picture, and choose when to follow them and when to ignore them (or, perhaps, adapt them).  I usually require myself to have a pretty good reason for not following a particular guideline, though.  Good software development is not anarchic!

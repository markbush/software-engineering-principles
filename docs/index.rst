Software Engineering Principles
===============================

This documentation contains a number of opinions of mine about Software Engineering.  I make no claim as to anything being *right* or *wrong*.  Opinions are, after all, just the ideas of a person.  However, my opinions are based on more than 40 years of writing software and, more importantly, of reading other people's code.  I provide this information purely in the hope that it will be useful to others.

Much of the information here can be found in numerous places around the Internet.  Unfortunately, it is often difficult to determine the accuracy of information gathered this way.  Also, much of it is not written well, or is not designed to be easily understood by someone new to the various concepts.  I fully recognise that the information here might not be easy to understand, either, however I am more than happy to receive criticism that will allow me to improve the content.

There are many code examples here.  I have chosen to use Java for these.  It should not be too challenging to convert these examples to other languages.

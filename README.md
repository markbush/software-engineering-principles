# Software Engineering Principles

This repository contains my own opinions on approaches to Software Engineering.

This will be added to regularly.  It is unlikely to include specifics of application frameworks, but will probably stick with general principles.

It will contain examples of how I, personally, view things and how this has enabled me to understand various concepts and approaches.  I hope that, over time as topics are added, it will help you, too.

A pre-formated PDF is also available [here](softwareengineeringprinciples.pdf).
